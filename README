put this folder in /var/www/html folder

and run ur apache.. on localhost

Some pointers to run:

Enable mod_rewrite module of the httpd.conf /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf 
i.e remove the #, (uncomment it)

If you are not using localhost, then change the localhost to your server ipaddress in "globalvar.php in /betterworks folder

Ensure that there is .htaccess file present in /betterworks directory. (unhide it to see it), its there in zipped files already you wudnt need to change anything.


It however should look like this:

RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^.*$ api/handler.php

which means any request to betterworks directory should be redirected to handler.php file in api folder.





Some simple ways to use the links are as follows:
http://localhost/betterworks/animals/
http://localhost/betterworks/animal/
http://localhost/betterworks/animal
http://localhost/betterworks/animals

http://localhost/betterworks/

http://localhost/betterworks/animals/herbivorous
http://localhost/betterworks/animals/carnivore
http://localhost/betterworks/animals/omnivorous
http://localhost/betterworks/animals/omnivore
http://localhost/betterworks/animals/herbivorous/cow
http://localhost/betterworks/animals/herbivorous/dog


In a Restful way , we show information in top down approach, i.e we only show necessary information till user asks for more..meanwhile providing
links to more detailed information.
